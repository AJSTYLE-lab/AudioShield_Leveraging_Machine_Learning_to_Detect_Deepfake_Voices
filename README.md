### How to run it on your own machine

1. Install the requirements

   ```
   $ pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the app

   ```
   $ streamlit run streamlit_app.py
   ```

**Problem Statement:**

The rise of deepfake technology, particularly in audio manipulation, presents a significant challenge to the integrity of audio content across various domains. In Bangladesh, the misuse of deepfake voices has raised concerns due to their potential to spread misinformation, undermine democratic processes, and disrupt emergency services. This project aims to develop a robust system leveraging machine learning techniques to detect deepfake voices, thereby safeguarding the integrity of audio content and protecting public welfare.

**Project Background:** 

Deepfakes are AI-generated content mimicking real audio, video, images, or text, raising concerns about their misuse. Deepfake voices, created with advanced algorithms, pose risks such as impersonation, misinformation, and fraud. In 2023, over 95,000 deepfakes were found online, a 550% increase since 2019, with a 10x rise in detections globally from 2022 to 2023.

This project aims to develop a machine learning system to detect deepfake voices accurately, addressing these challenges and protecting public welfare.
